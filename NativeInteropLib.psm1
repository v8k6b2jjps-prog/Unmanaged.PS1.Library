Also, it include in header files too, 
Check Microsoft Error Lookup Tool as example

there is also other place it could save, possibly,

could not find DLL Source, or Header file ? .. well

    .SYNOPSIS

    Should be called from -> Slc.dll
    but work from sppc.dll, osppc.dll
    maybe Slc.dll call sppc.dll -or osppc.dll

    Windows 10 DLL File Information - sppc.dll
    https://windows10dll.nirsoft.net/sppc_dll.html

    List of files that are statically linked to sppc.dll, 
    slc.dll, etc, etc, 
    This means that when one of the above files is loaded, 
    sppc.dll will be loaded too.
    (The opposite of the previous 'Static Linking' section)

    "OSPPC.dll" is a dynamic link library (DLL) file,
    that is a core component of Microsoft Office's Software Protection Platform.
    Essentially, it's involved in the licensing and activation of your Microsoft Office products.
    can be found under windows 7 ~ Vista, For older MSI version

    SLIsGenuineLocal, SLGetLicensingStatusInformation, SLGetWindowsInformation, SLGetWindowsInformationDWORD -> 
    is likely --> ZwQueryLicenseValue with: (Security-SPP-Action-StateData, Security-SPP-LastWindowsActivationHResult, etc)
    So, instead, use Get-ProductPolicy instead, to enum all value's

    >>> SLIsGenuineLocal function (slpublic.h)
    This function checks the **Tampered flag** of the license associated with the specified application. If the license is not valid, 
    or if the Tampered flag of the license is set, the installation is not considered valid. 

    >>> https://www.geoffchappell.com/studies/windows/km/ntoskrnl/api/ex/slmem/queryvalue.htm
    If the license has been **tampered with**, the function fails (returning STATUS_INTERNAL_ERROR). 
    If the licensing cache is corrupt, the function fails (returning STATUS_DATA_ERROR). 
    If there are no licensing descriptors but the kernel thinks it has the licensing descriptors sorted, 
    the function fails (returning STATUS_OJBECT_NAME_NOT_FOUND). 
    If the licensing descriptors are not sorted, they have to be.

.SYNOPSIS
Manages native UNICODE_STRING memory and content for P/Invoke.

.DESCRIPTION
This function allows for the creation of new UNICODE_STRING structures,
in-place updating of existing ones, and safe release of all associated
unmanaged memory (both the structure and its internal string buffer)
using low-level NTDLL APIs.

    Rebuilds a DACL memory pointer from an existing handle or ACE list.
    
    .DESCRIPTION
    Creates a new DACL by combining base ACEs (from -AclHandle or -AceList) with new ACEs (-AceToAdd).
    Used for adding, filtering, or copying a DACL.
    
    .NOTES
    -AclHandle enumerates ACEs, frees the old handle, and REQUIRES -AceToAdd.
    -AceList is used for filtered/pre-processed ACEs. Always allocates new memory.

Well-known SIDs
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/well-known-sids

The SECURITY_NT_AUTHORITY (S-1-5) predefined identifier authority produces SIDs that are not universal but are meaningful only on Windows installations.
You can use the following RID values with SECURITY_NT_AUTHORITY to create well-known SIDs.

SECURITY_LOCAL_SYSTEM_RID
String value: S-1-5-18
A special account used by the operating system.

The following table has examples of domain-relative RIDs that you can use to form well-known SIDs for **local groups** (aliases).
For more information about local and global groups, see Local Group Functions and Group Functions.

DOMAIN_ALIAS_RID_ADMINS
Value: 0x00000220
String value: S-1-5-32-544
A local group used for administration of the domain.

You don't get Pointer to [LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY] Offset 0x0, it depend
So, you need to consider, [LinkPtr] & [+Data Offset -0x00\0x10\0x20] -> Actual Offset of Data to read

[PEB_LDR_DATA] & 0x10 -> Read Pointer -> \ List Head [LIST_ENTRY]->Flink \ -> [LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY]->[LIST_ENTRY]->0x00 [AKA] InLoadOrderLinks           [& Repeat]
[PEB_LDR_DATA] & 0x20 -> Read Pointer -> \ List Head [LIST_ENTRY]->Flink \ -> [LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY]->[LIST_ENTRY]->0x10 [AKA] InMemoryOrderLinks         [& Repeat]
[PEB_LDR_DATA] & 0x30 -> Read Pointer -> \ List Head [LIST_ENTRY]->Flink \ -> [LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY]->[LIST_ENTRY]->0x20 [AKA] InInitializationOrderLinks [& Repeat]


.........................

- (*PPEB_LDR_DATA)->InMemoryOrderModuleList -> [LIST_ENTRY] head
- each [LIST_ENTRY] contain [*flink], which point to next [LIST_ENTRY]
- [LDR_DATA_TABLE] is also [LIST_ENTRY], first offset 0x0 is [LIST_ENTRY],
  Like this -> (LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY *) = (LIST_ENTRY *)

the result of this is!
[LIST_ENTRY] head, is actually [LIST_ENTRY] And not [LDR_DATA_TABLE]
only used to start the Loop chain, to Read the next [LDR_DATA_TABLE]
and than, read next [LDR_DATA_TABLE] item from [0x0  LIST_ENTRY] InLoadOrderLinks
which is actually [0x0] flink* -> pointer to another [LDR_DATA_TABLE]

C Code ->

LIST_ENTRY* head = &Peb->Ldr->InMemoryOrderModuleList;
LIST_ENTRY* current = head->Flink;

while (current != head) {
    LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY* module = (LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY*)current;
    wprintf(L"Loaded Module: %wZ\n", &module->FullDllName);
    current = current->Flink;

.SYNOPSIS
    Decodes Ring 3 Feature Control (FCON) runtime records.

.DESCRIPTION
    This implementation is a clean-room reverse engineering of the Windows 10/11 
    Feature Management subsystem. It specifically mirrors the logic found in:
    
    1. fcon.dll (The Packer): 
       Logic: StagingControls_EnumerateFeatures__lambda_...
       Task: Squashes 32-byte update structures into 12-byte runtime entries.
       
    2. EditionUpgradeManagerObj.dll (The Unpacker):
       Logic: wil_QueryFeatureState
       Task: Extracts 'Effective State' and 'Variant' for User-Mode consumption.

.NOTES
    VIVE COMPATIBILITY:
    This function represents the "Legacy" truth. It expects the State at Bit 4 
    and the Variant at Bit 8. If a feature was enabled via 'KernelMode' (Staging), 
    this reader may report 'Default' because it does not walk the Priority 
    Bucket stack (Bits 8, 10, 12) used by ntoskrnl.exe.

.SYNOPSIS
    Decodes Ring 0 Kernel Feature Configuration runtime records.

.DESCRIPTION
    This function is a clean-room reverse engineering of the Windows Executive 
    Feature Manager (ntoskrnl.exe). It implements the high-fidelity bit-masking 
    and priority-ladder logic used by the OS to resolve 'Staging' configurations.

    REVERSED FROM:
    1. wil_details_StagingConfig_QueryFeatureState:
       The primary kernel-mode state resolver.
       
    2. wil_details_StagingConfigFeature_HasUniqueState:
       The "Gatekeeper" logic. Determines if a record entry is valid or should 
       be ignored based on bucket occupancy and variant assignment.

.NOTES
    STAGING TRUTH:
    This function ignores the 'Legacy' bits (Bit 4) used by User-Mode tools. 
    Instead, it parses the Priority Buckets (Service, Override, Default) located 
    at Bits 8-13. This is the "Absolute Truth" of what the Kernel is actually 
    executing, regardless of what the UI reports.

Visiting Vibranium Velocity
A look at new changes to everyone favorite A/B system
https://medium.com/@thebookisclosed/visiting-vibranium-velocity-f1ae76253c67

Enter build 18963
Among the features this build introduces are these two: FconWritesToWNF and FconWritesToRTL. Here a quick rundown of the terminology used in these names.

* Fcon = Feature Configuration library (lives in System32)
* WNF = Windows Notification Facility
* RTL = Run-Time Library functions inside ntdll

Until this build, 
there were no centralized functions in the OS which would let developers explicitly work with features.
Programs had to work with a specific WNF state (basically a data blob) which was used for configuring features, 
the contents of which can be queried or written to.

Starting with build 18963, 
ntdll now sports a set of exports designed precisely for feature work. Those being:
RtlNotifyFeatureUsage
RtlQueryAllFeatureConfigurations
RtlQueryFeatureConfiguration
RtlQueryFeatureConfigurationChangeStamp
RtlQueryFeatureUsageNotificationSubscriptions
RtlRegisterFeatureConfigurationChangeNotification
RtlSetFeatureConfigurations
RtlSubscribeForFeatureUsageNotification
RtlUnregisterFeatureConfigurationChangeNotification
RtlUnsubscribeFromFeatureUsageNotifications
